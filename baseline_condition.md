To clarify the experimental design, this section provides an illustrative example of the baseline condition (see the table below), which serves as a control to isolate the effect of communication strategies. It is crucial to note that the baseline chatbot is not benign but also operates the identical malicious elicitation goal and employs the same stealthy response optimization process as the attack conditions. The distinction is that the baseline does not utilize one of the four specified psychological manipulation strategies, but attempts to elicit information through more direct, functional or contextually disconnected queries after addressing the user's primary task.
